  Imagine youâ€™re trying to solve a super-hard puzzle (like a jigsaw puzzle with millions of pieces). P=NP asks: If it's easy to check whether a puzzle is solved correctly, does that mean it's also easy to solve it in the first place?

  If someone shows you the completed puzzle, you can quickly say, "Yes, it fits!" But finding that solution might take forever. P=NP wonders if there's a shortcut to solving puzzles as easily as checking them.
