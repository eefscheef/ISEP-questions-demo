    Load Distribution: Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across servers.
    Database Scalability: Implement database sharding, replication, and indexing to handle large datasets.
    Caching: Use caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load and improve response times.
    Stateless Architecture: Design stateless services to make horizontal scaling easier.
    Microservices: Break the application into microservices to distribute the load and independently scale components.
    Asynchronous Processing: Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle long-running tasks asynchronously.
    CDN: Use CDNs to distribute static content and reduce latency.
